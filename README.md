delphi
========

Some very old projects preserved for historical purposes. They were made during college (2001-2004) using Delphi, when it was hip and amazing.

- ATField: a Mahjong-Evangelion mashup, imagined during my brief stint as an otaku
- CincoCores: just a graph theory assignment
- Dunno: that game in which you remove adjacent balls with same colors
- Einstein: MAGIC
- Turing: another college assignment
